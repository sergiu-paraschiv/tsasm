The idea is to preserve\n  // \"Pause on exceptions\" behavior. Because React wraps all user-provided\n  // functions in invokeGuardedCallback, and the production version of\n  // invokeGuardedCallback uses a try-catch, all user exceptions are treated\n  // like caught exceptions, and the DevTools won't pause unless the developer\n  // takes the extra step of enabling pause on caught exceptions. This is\n  // unintuitive, though, because even though React has caught the error, from\n  // the developer's perspective, the error is uncaught.\n  //\n  // To preserve the expected \"Pause on exceptions\" behavior, we don't use a\n  // try-catch in DEV. Instead, we synchronously dispatch a fake event to a fake\n  // DOM node, and call the user-provided callback from inside an event handler\n  // for that fake event. If the callback throws, the error is \"captured\" using\n  // a global event handler. But because the error happens in a different\n  // event loop context, it does not interrupt the normal program flow.\n  // Effectively, this gives us try-catch behavior without actually using\n  // try-catch. Neat!\n\n  // Check that the browser supports the APIs we need to implement our special\n  // DEV version of invokeGuardedCallback\n  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && typeof window.dispatchEvent === 'function' && typeof document !== 'undefined' && typeof document.createEvent === 'function') {\n    var fakeNode = document.createElement('react');\n\n    var invokeGuardedCallbackDev = function (name, func, context, a, b, c, d, e, f) {\n      // If document doesn't exist we know for sure we will crash in this method\n      // when we call document.createEvent().

If a work-in-progress render is discarded before finishing,\n// we create a new work-in-progress by cloning the current queue.\n//\n// Both queues share a persistent, singly-linked list structure. To schedule an\n// update, we append it to the end of both queues. Each queue maintains a\n// pointer to first update in the persistent list that hasn't been processed.\n// The work-in-progress pointer always has a position equal to or greater than\n// the current queue, since we always work on that one. The current queue's\n// pointer is only updated during the commit phase, when we swap in the\n// work-in-progress.\n//\n// For example:\n//\n//   Current pointer:           A - B - C - D - E - F\n//   Work-in-progress pointer:              D - E - F\n//                                          ^\n//                                          The work-in-progress queue has\n//                                          processed more updates than current.\n//\n// The reason we append to both queues is because otherwise we might drop\n// updates without ever processing them. For example, if we only add updates to\n// the work-in-progress queue, some updates could be lost whenever a work-in\n// -progress render restarts by cloning from current. Similarly, if we only add\n// updates to the current queue, the updates will be lost whenever an already\n// in-progress queue commits and swaps with the current queue. However, by\n// adding to both queues, we guarantee that the update will be part of the next\n// work-in-progress. (And because the work-in-progress queue becomes the\n// current queue once it commits, there's no danger of applying the same\n// update twice.)\n//\n// Prioritization\n// --------------\n//\n// Updates are not sorted by priority, but by insertion; new updates are always\n// appended to the end of the list.\n//\n// The priority is still important, though. When processing the update queue\n// during the render phase, only the updates with sufficient priority are\n// included in the result. If we skip an update because it has insufficient\n// priority, it remains in the queue to be processed later, during a lower\n// priority render. Crucially, all updates subsequent to a skipped update also\n// remain in the queue *regardless of their priority*. That means high priority\n// updates are sometimes processed twice, at two separate priorities. We also\n// keep track of a base state, that represents the state before the first\n// update in the queue is applied.\n//\n// For example:\n//\n//   Given a base state of '', and the following queue of updates\n//\n//     A1 - B2 - C1 - D2\n//\n//   where the number indicates the priority, and the update is applied to the\n//   previous state by appending a letter, React will process these updates as\n//   two separate renders, one per distinct priority level:\n//\n//   First render, at priority 1:\n//     Base state: ''\n//     Updates: [A1, C1]\n//     Result state: 'AC'\n//\n//   Second render, at priority 2:\n//     Base state: 'A'            <-  The base state does not include C1,\n//                                    because B2 was skipped.\n//     Updates: [B2, C1, D2]      <-  C1 was rebased on top of B2\n//     Result state: 'ABCD'\n//\n// Because we process updates in insertion order, and rebase high priority\n// updates when preceding updates are skipped, the final result is deterministic\n// regardless of priority. Intermediate state may vary according to system\n// resources, but the final state is always the same.\n\nvar UpdateState = 0;\nvar ReplaceState = 1;\nvar ForceUpdate = 2;\nvar CaptureUpdate = 3;\n\n// Global state that is reset at the beginning of calling `processUpdateQueue`.\n// It should only be read right after calling `processUpdateQueue`, via\n// `checkHasForceUpdateAfterProcessing`.\nvar hasForceUpdate = false;\n\nvar didWarnUpdateInsideUpdate = void 0;\nvar currentlyProcessingQueue = void 0;\n\n{\n  didWarnUpdateInsideUpdate = false;\n  currentlyProcessingQueue = null;\n  \n}\n\nfunction createUpdateQueue(baseState) {\n  var queue = {\n    baseState: baseState,\n    firstUpdate: null,\n    lastUpdate: null,\n    firstCapturedUpdate: null,\n    lastCapturedUpdate: null,\n    firstEffect: null,\n    lastEffect: null,\n    firstCapturedEffect: null,\n    lastCapturedEffect: null\n  };\n  return queue;\n}\n\nfunction cloneUpdateQueue(currentQueue) {\n  var queue = {\n    baseState: currentQueue.baseState,\n    firstUpdate: currentQueue.firstUpdate,\n    lastUpdate: currentQueue.lastUpdate,\n\n    // TODO: With resuming, if we bail out and resuse the child tree, we should\n    // keep these effects.\n    firstCapturedUpdate: null,\n    lastCapturedUpdate: null,\n\n    firstEffect: null,\n    lastEffect: null,\n\n    firstCapturedEffect: null,\n    lastCapturedEffect: null\n  };\n  return queue;\n}\n\nfunction createUpdate(expirationTime, suspenseConfig) {\n  var update = {\n    expirationTime: expirationTime,\n    suspenseConfig: suspenseConfig,\n\n    tag: UpdateState,\n    payload: null,\n    callback: null,\n\n    next: null,\n    nextEffect: null\n  };\n  {\n    update.priority = getCurrentPriorityLevel();\n  }\n  return update;\n}\n\nfunction appendUpdateToQueue(queue, update) {\n  // Append the update to the end of the list.\n  if (queue.lastUpdate === null) {\n    // Queue is empty\n    queue.firstUpdate = queue.lastUpdate = update;\n  } else {\n    queue.lastUpdate.next = update;\n    queue.lastUpdate = update;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction enqueueUpdate(fiber, update) {\n  // Update queues are created lazily.\n  var alternate = fiber.alternate;\n  var queue1 = void 0;\n  var queue2 = void 0;\n  if (alternate === null) {\n    // There's only one fiber.\n    queue1 = fiber.updateQueue;\n    queue2 = null;\n    if (queue1 === null) {\n      queue1 = fiber.updateQueue = createUpdateQueue(fiber.memoizedState);\n    }\n  } else {\n    // There are two owners.\n    queue1 = fiber.updateQueue;\n    queue2 = alternate.updateQueue;\n    if (queue1 === null) {\n      if (queue2 === null) {\n        // Neither fiber has an update queue.
